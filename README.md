# Title

Study and Implementation of NumPy Library for Numerical Computations in Python

# Aim

To study the features of the NumPy library and perform various numerical operations such as array creation, indexing, slicing, mathematical operations, and statistical computations using NumPy.

# Objectives

To understand the concept of NumPy arrays.

To learn how to create one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

To perform indexing and slicing operations on arrays.

To apply mathematical and statistical operations using NumPy functions.

To understand reshaping, aggregation, and manipulation of arrays.

To compare NumPy arrays with Python lists in terms of performance and efficiency.

# Theory

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source library used for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

The core object of NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array). Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements in an array must be of the same data type. This property makes NumPy arrays more memory efficient and faster than traditional lists.

# Key concepts of NumPy include:

1. Array Creation

NumPy provides various methods to create arrays such as creating arrays from lists, generating arrays filled with zeros or ones, creating identity matrices, and generating arrays with evenly spaced values.

2. Array Attributes

Each array has attributes such as:

Shape (dimensions of the array)

Size (total number of elements)

Data type (type of elements stored)

Number of dimensions

3. Indexing and Slicing

Indexing is used to access specific elements of an array, while slicing is used to extract a portion of the array. NumPy supports advanced indexing methods that allow flexible data selection.

4. Mathematical Operations

NumPy allows element-wise arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports vectorized operations, meaning operations can be performed on entire arrays without using loops.

5. Statistical Functions

NumPy provides built-in functions to calculate statistical values such as mean, median, standard deviation, sum, minimum, and maximum.

6. Reshaping and Manipulation

Arrays can be reshaped into different dimensions without changing the data. Other operations include concatenation, splitting, stacking, and transposing arrays.

Advantages of NumPy

Faster execution due to optimized C implementation

Efficient memory usage

Supports multi-dimensional data

Widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing

# Summary
